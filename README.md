# Revenant fixer

This script fixes some broken dialogue in the 1999 game [Revenant](https://www.gog.com/game/revenant).

The solution was provided by several posters in [this GOG thread](https://www.gog.com/forum/revenant/bug_missing_voicetext_early_on_in_the_game_spoiler), and this script just automates that process.

Usage: go to the `Modules` path within the game installation directory and run the `fix.sh` script from wherever you saved it.

I'll try to update the script if I spot more broken dialogue, but please open an issue or submit a pull request if you know of any places I missed.
